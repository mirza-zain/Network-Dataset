## Overview

The "Network Dataset" repository provides network traffic data captured using Wireshark. This data can be used for analyzing network performance, security research, protocol analysis, and educational purposes.

## Dataset Description

The dataset includes packet captures (PCAP files) from different network scenarios. Each capture file is accompanied by a brief description of the network environment and the type of traffic it contains.

### Captures Included

- `capture1.pcap`

## Usage

To use the dataset, download the desired PCAP files and open them with a network analysis tool such as Wireshark. You can perform various analyses, such as:

- Protocol analysis
- Traffic pattern analysis
- Security and intrusion detection
- Network troubleshooting

## Data Collection

The data in this repository was collected by visiting random websites, playing videos on YouTube, and running HTTP websites. This allows for a comprehensive analysis of different types of network traffic, including HTTP traffic. This dataset can also be used for further studies and can be fed into AI models for training and analysis.

## Requirements

To analyze the dataset, you will need:

- [Wireshark](https://www.wireshark.org/) or any compatible network analysis tool.
